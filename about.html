  <h1>About ElectroSolve</h1>
  <p>
  ElectroSolve is an educational software project developed to support learning in basic electrical engineering. The application was built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and later packaged into a mobile app using MIT App Inventor.
The idea behind ElectroSolve came from the common challenge faced by students who struggle to remember formulas or perform electrical calculations during practical lessons. Instead of relying only on textbooks or calculators, ElectroSolve provides a digital solution that performs calculations automatically and displays results clearly.
This project emphasizes:
Problem-solving using software
Practical learning in electrical engineering
ElectroSolve is not intended to replace professional engineering tools. Instead, it serves as a learning aid for understanding basic concepts such as voltage, current, resistance, and power.
The project also demonstrates how a simple idea can be transformed into a functional application using limited resources. It encourages students to use technology creatively to solve everyday academic and technical problems.
